Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good

I tell them bitches anyway
'Cause we don't care what none of them gyal affi say
You can't stop me, I'ma fulfill my prophecy
I do it, I did it, the proper way
Ah, my property, now watch how we operate
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice
The V.I.P lights is hitting us just right
So if you getting money, just throw it up in the air
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer
'Cause I, I, I, I am Zolanski
Some call me Barbie, yes, I'm life-size
Yes, I am humble, yes, but why lie?
I am the reason why these girls go bye-bye!

Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good (Yo)

Okay, now, this right here can get me in trouble
'Cause when I say I ball, I don't mean in a huddle
I'm always in the lime, I never do nothing subtle
'Cause it's Pink Friday, ho! That's their rebuttal
My two guns up, let's blaze it, let's go
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow
And when I'm at the game, I'm in the best row
I am the baddest bitch up in the pet store
'Cause I, I, I, I am Onika
And these shoes here mean fashionista
'Cause these don't come out 'til it's Easter
I'm V.I.P bound with Leighton Meester

Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good

Anyway, bitch, I look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good
Anyway, bitch, I look good
