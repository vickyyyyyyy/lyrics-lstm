Hey, you, jump in this ride
It's real nice and slippery inside
Wise guy, come get this pie
Ri-ri-ri-ride it, ride it in style
Said it a minute ago, I did it a minute ago
I drop it, I pick it up slow, I want it, I'm kicking it though
'Cause they know that I got that good shit
Said I'm bad but I could be a good bitch

Squeeze my body, rock my body
Boy, you make me go
Na, na, na, na, na me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
Na, na, na, na, na me go

We gon'

Hey stranger over there
I'm really liking the way
You whip it whip it
Yeah, I want you everyday
You're so right
You're so tight

You got my world spinning
You got my world spinning
My head goes round and around, round and around
Now I'm thinking
If we could be stranger. What you say?
I'm really liking the way
You whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it

Na, na, na, na, na me go
Na, na, na, na, na me go

Is that my cue?
I'm looking for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like 5'2"
My SAT scores was high, too

But I don't mean to brag I Louis-Vuitton-bagged 'em
Hopped out the jag proceeded to sha-shag 'em
Slim, trim, also light skin
So Pe-Pe-Peter put the pipe in

Squeeze my body, rock my body
Boy, you make me go
Na, na, na, na, na me go
Please my body, heal my body
Boy, you make me go
Na, na, na, na, na me go

We gon'

Hey stranger over there
I'm really liking the way
You whip it whip it
Yeah, I want you everyday
You're so right
You're so tight

You got my world spinning
You got my world spinning
My head goes round and around, round and around
Now I'm thinking
If we could be stranger. What you say?
I'm really liking the way
You whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it whip it

Na, na, na, na, na me go
Na, na, na, na, na me go
