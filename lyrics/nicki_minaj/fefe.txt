Got that super soaker, hit that, she a Fefe
Her name Keke, she eat my dick like it's free, free
I don't even know like "Why I did that?"
I don't even know like "Why I hit that?"
All I know is that I just can't wife that
Talk to her nice so she won't fight back
Turn around and hit it from the back, back, back
Bend her down then I make it clap, clap, clap

I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Draco got that kick-back, when I blow that, they all do track
They don't shoot back, one shot, close range, red dot
Head tight, yeah, I did that, yeah, I live that
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
Niggas say they killin' people, but I really fuckin' do it

I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Nicki Minaj:]
He-He tryna 69 like Tekashi, call him papi
Word to A$AP, keep me Rocky
I'm from New York, so I'm cocky, say he fuckin' with my posse
Copped me Khlo√© like Kardashi', keep this pussy in Versace
Said I'm pretty like Tinashe
Put it all up in his face, did I catch a case?
Pussy game just caught a body, but I never leave a trace
Face is pretty, ass for days, I get chips, I ask for Lay's
I just sit back and when he done, I be like, "Yo, how'd it taste?"
(Yo, how'd it taste?!)

[6ix9ine:]
I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

[Nicki Minaj:]
Ayo, Draco got that kick-back
When it kick-back, you can't get yo shit back, in fact this that bitch

Kick that ho right through the door (no, TR3YWAY)
