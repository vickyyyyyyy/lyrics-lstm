Girl how your hot, and you're sexy and pretty
Me, your cherry me want picky
But it's not every girl in my life I've introduced to my mamma
But you are the girl I man choose to give honor
So when some careless girl a come with them silly drama
Tell them pause like a sentence, me using the comma
Make we visit Marc Jacobs and call the wedding planner
For a romantic setting in the middle of the savanna
'Cause love is in the air and it a-wave like a banner
Now the heart in a me chest is like a hammer!

I love it when you're on top
Worst when you go back shot
None of them nah have that
Some of them running we a go tell them girl YOLO
We a go tell them girl YOLO
'Cause I love it when you're on top
Worst when you go back shot
None of them nah have that
Some of them running we a go tell them girl YOLO
We a go tell them girl YOLO
