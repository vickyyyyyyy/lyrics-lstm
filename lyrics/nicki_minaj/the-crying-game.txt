[Nicki Minaj:]
Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spades in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

[Nicki Minaj:]
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

[Jessie Ware:]
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know

[Jessie Ware:]
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing
We're back to playing
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing
The crying game

[Jessie Ware 2x:]
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing
The crying game

[Nicki Minaj:]
Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved
(To love and be loved)

[Nicki Minaj:]
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
Cause the tears don't end

[Jessie Ware:]
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know

[Jessie Ware:]
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing
We're back to playing
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're back to playing
The crying game

[Jessie Ware 2x:]
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing
The crying game

[Jessie Ware:]
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
