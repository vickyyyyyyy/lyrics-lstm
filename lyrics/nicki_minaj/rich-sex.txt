I know what these niggas like, and it ain't my charm
I ain't stupid, this $250 on my arm
I like money more than dick, nigga, that's a fact
You think pussy's everything? Well, let's have a chat
A-a-ass out, pussy fat, point me to a rich nigga
Who gon' Rico, Ace me, pay in full my money, Mitch, nigga
I'ma help 'em fuck the check up, I'ma run the business
If your girl don't get it popping', put me on your wishlist Hitlist, now we sending gifts like if it's Christmas
He say "Baby, everyday we ballin'", I say, "Swish, swish"
Got him calling' nonstop 'cause he don't wanna miss this
I said, "Don't panic, keep the faith, nigga bigs bitch:
(Real rich nigga sex)

If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck
(Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up
(Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer
(Rich sex)
It ain't such a thing as broke and handsome
(Rich sex)

If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin'
(Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin'
(Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin'
(Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin'

Lil mamma said she only fuckin' on a rich dick
I cum in her face and tell her now you lookin' rich, bitch
Her friend in the other room, can I get a witness?
We could have rich sex, can I have no rich kick backs?
All my bitches have no limits
Fucked her in a helicopter
Now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Fuck her in the drop top
Now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Sent her back to who she with
Now she screamin' while she with him
Lil mama said she only suckin' on a rich dick
Make you put your money where your mouth
Babe, that some lipstick
Let's fuck on that money, 'fore we count that
That's some rich shit
Pussy smell like money when I'm down her
That some Nik shit
(Real rich nigga sex)
