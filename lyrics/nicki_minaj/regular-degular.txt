Thick in the thighs, wet as the ocean, he fixin’ to dive

Up in the skies, I am so famous, I need a disguise
Cuttin’ some ties, that’s word to Kendrick, they killin’ my vibe

Thick in the thighs, thin in the waist, I be catching them eyes
Look at the ice, whippin’ that work, I be flippin’ them pies
Flippin’ them pies, givin’ him work whenever he applies
Look at the size, supersi-ize, I ain’t talkin’ the fries
