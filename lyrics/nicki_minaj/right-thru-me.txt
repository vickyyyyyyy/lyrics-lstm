You see right through me
How do you do that shit? [3x]
How do you [5x]

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they looking, you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride

The good advice, I always hated
But looking back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up

Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I trying, no, you ain't buying
I tried to fight it, back with defiance

You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yelling at you and getting at you
Picking up dishes, throwing 'em at you
Why are you speaking when no one asked you?

You see right through me
How do you do that shit? [3x]
How do you [5x]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit? [3x]
How do you [5x]

What are we doing? Could you see through me?
'Cause you say, "Nicki," and I say, "Who? Me?"
And you say, "No you," and I say, "Screw you."

Then you start dressing and you start leaving
And I start crying, and I start screaming
The heavy breathin'
But what's the reason

Always get the reaction
You wanted
I'm actually
Fronting
I'm asking you something yo

Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of letting passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
OK, you're right just let it go
OK you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand

You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

You see right through me
How do you do that shit [3x]
How do you [5x]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit [3x]
How do you [5x]

Stop! Stop!
Won't you just stop looking through me
'Cause I can't take it?
No, I can't take it

You see right through me
How do you do that shit [3x]
How do you [5x]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit [3x]
How do you [5x]
