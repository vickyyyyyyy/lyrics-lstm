[Foxy Brown & Nicki Minaj:]
Whole lotta gang shit
Oh, uh, ugh, ayy yo Chun
Uh, ayy yo Chun

Whole lotta gang shit
Haha, every bitch bloodclaat, you heard me
Oh, ayy yo, uh, Brooklyn!
Kick for my stomach, let's go!
Yo!

[Nicki Minaj:]
He got me like a coco, yeah uh la coco
Ellas quieren coco, y yo tampoco
Never trust a broke hoe, don't fuck with po-po
Numero uno, me llama Yoko
Pull up in them thing things and them things fling
Niggas know my name ring, and it go "ding-ding"
If I get an inkling, the thing'll sing-sing
Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting

Ayo, if I'm in the Gurkha, then they in the back of it
If I tell 'em eat food, then they make a snack of it
If they take your cocaine then they make a crack of it
If they grab your gold chain then they make a plaque of it
Know we never lack on it, run up with the MAC on it
Put a couple racks on it, they gon' put the whack on it
She got the Nicki bundles, worth a stack on it
That's word to Brook' now, that's word to Bucktown
That's word to Harlem World, shout out to uptown
You know I shine on 'em, I spray sheen on 'em
That's word to southside, Jamaica, Queens on 'em
I'm mad Queens on 'em, with mad schemes on 'em
I never scale back, the triple beams on 'em
My ice gleams on 'em, Wu-Tang creams on 'em
I pull up on the block bumpin' Biggie "Dreams" on 'em
A nigga greased on 'em, but ice freezed on 'em
I light breezed on 'em, I might breeze on 'em
Might do it like it's Christmas and light trees on 'em
I see the copycats bitin' my steez on 'em

He got me like a coco, yeah uh la coco
Ellas quieren coco, y yo tampoco
Never trust a broke hoe, don't fuck with po-po
Numero uno, me llama Yoko
Pull up in them thing things and them things fling
Niggas know my name ring, and it go "ding-ding"
If I get an inkling, the thing'll sing-sing
Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting

[Foxy Brown & Nicki Minaj:]

So tell 'em run, come and bring a lump sum
Ayo Fox, they don't make us or break us, word to young guns
Put your hands up

Run a Kartel, Dem fi 'fraid Vybz
They call me Ms. Bitch, but I don't miss, bitch
Got real shooters, better D up, guys
Who me? I'm physically fine
Who she? It's like we know she dyin'
Bitch ain't see Billboard in 2017
Had to drop Queen on 'em like a guillotine
All these jealous bitches on the jelly team
Keepin' it a hundred, that's a jelly bean
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
