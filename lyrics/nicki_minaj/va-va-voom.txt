Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could come inside of my play pen
'Cause he look like a superstar in the making
So I think that I'm going in for the taking

Hear through the grape vine that he caking
We could shoot a movie, he could do the taping
Boom, boom pow, this thing be shaking
I ain't even tryna find out who he dating

'Cause I know he got a wife at home)
But I need just one night alone)
If he keep playing them kidding games)
I'mma run away aye, I'mma run away aye aye)

I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If you're looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it I'm gonna be va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom

Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could become my little problem
'Cause he look like he modeling clothes in Dublin
So I think that he gettin' that Green like goblin

Hear through the grape vine that he hang low
We could shoot a movie, kabang, like Rambo
Boom, boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wondering if he could understand my lingo

'Cause I know he got a wife at home)
But I need just one night alone)
If he keep playing them kidding games)
I'mma run away aye, I'mma run away aye aye)

I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If you're looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it I'm gonna be va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom, boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
