Zipping, I'm zipping, I'm zipping
Soon as they come out I'm dipping
Big ass closet, I'm tripping
Big booty strippers, I'm tipping
Big ass chain, I'm heavy
And it didn't cost me a penny
They pay me to rock it
Damn, I got niggas in pocket
Superbowl, Grammies
What a hell of a jammie!
All these bitches my sons
I'mma get 'em a nanny
Argentina for Pepsi, Orlando All-Star
Fuck you said bitch? Fuck you, porn star
I don't do shotgun, I be driving my own car
I don't do shots neither, I'm buying the whole bar
Holy moley, G copped me a Rolly
I ain't catching the puck
But iced out like a goalie nigga

[4x]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-you-you, y-you-you Soul Train

I travel more than you walking with a basketball
I'm out in Spain, running game to the matador
I'm in my own lane, you ain't in my category
You like a Rav 4, I'm like the Aventador
Birkin bags, man I merc them ads
When I re-up on "Reloaded" I'mma hurt them bad
Every shoot is hot, when I'm out I'm spotted
They gon' frame the receipt if I sign the dotted
N-n-niggas on Banshees is speeding
Dirt bikes is out for the season
Back break wheelie and leaning
Damn, a bitch late for a meeting
N-N-NYPD coming
Belt Parkway, we gunning
Double R engine humming
Acting a fool, we dumbing

I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-you-you, y-you-you Soul Train

[2x]
N-N-Nintendo and we in the end-zone
I don't give a fuck hoe, like we in the friend zone
What the fuck it look like? What the fuck it's hitting for?
Tell them bitches "Y-y-y-y-you ain't about that life!"

[Sounds of motorcycles speeding by]

I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-you-you, y-you-you Soul Train
