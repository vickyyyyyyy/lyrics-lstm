Don't be goofy, bring some passion to the table, what you doin'?
Don't be stupid, I'm the realest bitch you know, yeah, I'm the truest
When you pull up, gotta pull up on me like you already knew it
Yeah, you keep saying you the truth when, nigga, you gon' have to prove it

'Cause it's been a minute since I trusted somebody
'Cause I don't ever put my trust in nobody
I hate to picture you out fuckin' somebody
So I don't ever put my trust in nobody

Who am I to deny?
Yeah, you say who am I to run and hide?

Don't be jealous, put some trust inside your text when you be textin'
Tell the truth when you get tired of me askin' all them questions
I pray to God for peace and love, I'm lookin' at you as a blessing
You told me life ain't luck and love, so take that passion as a lesson

'Cause it's been a minute since I trusted somebody
'Cause I don't ever put my trust in nobody
I hate to picture you out fuckin' somebody
So I don't ever put my trust in nobody

Who am I to deny?
Yeah, you say who am I to run and hide?
