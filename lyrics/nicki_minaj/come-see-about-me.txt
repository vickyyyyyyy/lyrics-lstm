Come, come see what I've been up to
Come, come see about me
I know you've had a lot of work to do
Ooh, you got used to things without me baby
Yeah, you got used to every thing I never did
You got sick of being sick of all my flaws
You got over all the pain I ever caused
And I didn't mean it, no, ooh, but

They say it's all what you make it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
So please don't try to deny me of it, no
You know my heart couldn't take it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love you can't fake it
See baby, ooh you know I need you to

Come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Know it can't always be about me
Just come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
I'm doing good boy, I'm up where we belong, yeah
You know I'm still trying to find where we went wrong, yeah
So come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Come, come, come see about me
It won't hurt just to see what we could be, so...
Come see about me, yeah

Want you to see how much I changed up
Ooh, I just hope I'm not too late
I know your hesitant about it but
I got a lot I wanna say to you
Hate that I could never measure up
Hate that I could never be the one you needed
'Cause now I'm the one who needs you
But baby

They say it's all what you make it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
So please don't try to deny me of that, no
You know my heart couldn't take it
Maybe it's all in the making
Love's always love, you can't fake it
See baby, ooh you know I need you too

Come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
Know it can't always be about me
Just come, come see about me
Come, come see about me
