[Nicki Minaj (Ariana Grande):]
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees!)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby, just say pretty please (pretty please!)

[Nicki Minaj:]
I'll be back at 11, you just act like a peasant
Got a bow on my panties because my ass is a present
Yeah, it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'

[Explicit version:]
I be laughing when you begging me to just put the head in
Let me sit on your face, it's OK, you can play with it
When I'm bouncing, it chill out, and don't you make a mistake with it

[Clean version:]
I appreciate the gifts like the whips and them bezels
Now it's bells and the whistles, now I'm makin' it sizzle
And it's ready, come and get it, it's takin' off like a missile

Let me see what you're workin' with, if I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah, I bagged him, I Birkin'd it

[Ariana Grande:]
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby, I'mma need you to beg for it

[Nicki Minaj (Ariana Grande):]
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees!)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby, just say pretty please (pretty please!)

[Nicki Minaj:]
Gimme brain, assume the position
Make me way smarter like you was a magician
Paid my dues and tuition
It's good for your nutrition
Get head like a beautician,
Got me twitchin', finish your mission
You make it come down, you make it rundown
I'mma need you to give these other dudes the run down
You got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry

[Ariana Grande:]
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby, I'mma need you to beg for it

[Ariana Grande (Nicki Minaj):]
(Let's go)
'Cause we are just animals
Baby, it's primal (it's primal....)
I want you on all fours
(And before I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl)
If you want it all (yeah, you want it all?)
It's non negotiable
So do as I say
(If you wanna get the job, you better know who's the boss)

[Ariana Grande:]
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby, I'mma need you to beg for it

[Nicki Minaj (Ariana Grande):]
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees!)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby, just say pretty please (pretty please!)
