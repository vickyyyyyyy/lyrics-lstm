Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

St-st-step up in the party like my name was "That Bitch"
All these haters mad because I'm so established
They know I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a fuckin' savage
Haters, you could kill yourself (Ah)
In my space shuttle and I'm not comin' down
I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes, it's just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't comin' back this time

I can't believe it, it's so amazin'
This club is heated, this party's blazin'
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin'
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, ch-check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out

St-st-step up in the party like my name is Mr. T
All these hating naggers ain't got nat'in' on me
Honestly, I gotta stay as fly as I can be
If you Wiki Willy, you get super OG
Honeys always rush me 'cause I'm fly, fly, fly
Dummies, they can't touch me 'cause I'm floatin' sky high
I stay niggarific, you don't need to ask why
You just gotta see with your eyes

I can't believe it, it's so amazin'
This club is heated, this party's blazin'
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin'
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, ch-check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out

Check this motherfucker out
It got me in the club, in the club just rocking like this
Oh, oh

Da-dun-dun
The sun done, yep, the sun done
Came up, but we still up in dungeon
Da-dun-dun, yep, in London
Competition? Why, yes, I would love some
How the fuck they get mad 'cause their run done?
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' money in abundance?
Man, I can't even count all of these hundreds
Duffel bag every time I go to SunTrust
I leave the rest just to collect interest
I mean interest, fuck my nemesis
Exclamation, just for emphasis
And I don't sympathize 'cause you a simple bitch
I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple shit
And put the iron to your face, you old wrinkled bitch

This is mega nigga, u-u-ultra enigmatic
-matic, -matic, -matic, -ma-ma-matic

Oh, we just had to kill it
We on the radio, hotter than a skillet
We in the club, makin' party people holla
Money in the bank, we be gettin' top dollar
I'm a big baller, you a lil' smaller
Step up to my level, need to grow a lil' taller
I'm a shot caller, get up off my collar
You a Chihuahua, I'm a Rottweiler

I can't believe it, it's so amazin' (Yeah)
I can't believe it, this beat is bangin' (Yeah)
I can't believe it, it's so amazin' (Yeah)
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

Hey, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out, ch-check it out
Check it out, check it out, yeah, yeah, I'm feelin' it now
Check it out, check it out, check it out
