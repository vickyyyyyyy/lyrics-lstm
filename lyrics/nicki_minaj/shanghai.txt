On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter

On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Roll upon ya, roll upon ya
Roll upon ya, roll upon ya

Eight mil on that new thing, tied up like my shoe string
Ain't fucking with you bitch niggas, and that's real rap but I do sing
Make room when I come by, ain't speaking, I'm dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, it's a matter of time before one dies

'Cause them dudes out and them tools out, all sixes like school's out
Niggas know if they talk slick that I'm winter fresh, they'll get chewed out

'Cause them dudes out and them tools out, all sixes like school's out
Niggas know if they talk slick that I'm winter fresh, they'll get chewed out

This shit ain't regular rich, so they end up in a ditch
I'm not a regular bitch, so when niggas see me, they jump on my dick
He not a regular shooter, so when you see me, salute-a
Ain't got a knife in my hand, but I'm choppin' it up with some niggas from Cuba

On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter

On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Roll upon ya, roll upon ya
Roll upon ya, roll upon ya

Ask Jay who he married, 80 thousand in Paris
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie got them aggy
These bitches is light-weight, I'm always at fight-weight
Wrist game is on ice skate, 'cause we move work through that Tri-State

'Cause them boys out, and them toys out, still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter time or that Mayweather like Floyd's out

'Cause them boys out, and them toys out, still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter time or that Mayweather like Floyd's out

All of these bitches in pocket, I'm 'bout to make a deposit
Tell 'em to go 'head and gossip, as long as your house is the size of my closet
Anybody I call, they picks up, even if they was gettin' they dick sucked
These niggas don't make a mix-up, tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up (tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up)

On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter

On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Roll upon ya, roll upon ya
Roll upon ya, roll upon ya
