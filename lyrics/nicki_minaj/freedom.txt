They never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful
I remain a staple

My career's been a pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct

Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophesy every thing I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew

So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine,
Baby and Slim came
Tezz and E.I. told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing
I could've went insane
And even now I think, "Do I really want this fame?"

Let me get up and go, 700 to go
Overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man I'm birthing these artists
And I'm starting to show

I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn an L
'Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn an L
'Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

Who I wanna work with? Nobody
99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say they copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles

B-b-b-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival
Then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital
I'm busy, never idle

I'm your idol, I'm your idol, I'm your motherfuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's
Thongs and some pasties
Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here?
'Cause I must've missed it
12 milli to kick my feet up
Get ready this is the re-up

I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn an L
'Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn an L
'Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?
I just have to decide
What you hiding from?
What you hiding from?

Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?
I just have to decide
What you hiding from?
What you hiding from?
Hiding baby

Would you, would you
Give your
Would you, would you
Give your
Would you, would you
Give your all for your

Would you, would you
Give your
Would you, would you
Give your
Would you, would you
Give your all for your

I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn an L
'Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn an L
'Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
