[Nicki Minaj:]
Doctor, doctor, need you back home, baby
Doctor, doctor, where you at?
Give me something
I need your love
I need your love
I need your loving
You got that kind of medicine that keeps me comin'

My body needs a hero
Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling weird
Oh! I need you to come and rescue me

Oh

[Chorus:]
Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on

Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on

[Nicki Minaj:]
Oh, you make it, make it right
My temperature is super high
If I scream, if I cry
It's only 'cause I feel alive

My body needs a hero
Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling weird
Oh! I need you to come and rescue me

Oh

[Chorus:]
Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on

Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on

[Bridge:]
You've got my life in the palm of your hands (palm of your hands)
Come and save me now
I know you can, I know you can

Dat-dat-dat-dat-don't let me die young, I just want you to father my young
I just want you to be my doctor, we can get it crackin' chiropractor, I, I, I, I

I, I, I, I know you can save me
And make me feel alive

[Chorus:]
Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
