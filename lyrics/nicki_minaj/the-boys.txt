[Nicki Minaj:]
Punch line Queen, no boxer though
Might pull up in a Porsche, no boxster though
Tell a hater, "Yo, don't you got cocks to blow?"
Tell 'em Kangaroo Nick, I'll box a hoe
Shoulda shoulda said I got 5 in a possible
Don't go against Nicki, impossible
I done came through with my wrist on popsicle
Man these hoes couldn't ball with a testicle
Nigga

[Cassie:]
Your lipstick stain
Smells like a cheap hotel
Diamond watches and a gold chain
Can't make my frown turn around

The boys always spending all their money on love
The boys always spending all their money on love
They wanna touch it, taste it, see it, feel it, bone it, own it
Dollar, dollar, paper chase it, get that money

You get high, fuck a bunch of girls
And then cry on top of the world
I hope you have the time of your life
I hope I don't lose it tonight

[Nicki Minaj:]
Bald head pussy got lots of juice
Lop-sided on the curb so I block the coupes
Watch the deuce
Man I'm stingy with my kitty cat diddy
Did you ever really love me Stevie?
Rrrrrrr
Pull up in the rrrrrrr
Wrist on burrrrr
Pussy on purrrr rrrrr
I don't even brake when I'm backing up
I'll swerve on a nigga if he acting up
I done pushed more sixes than a play date
Get money by the millions, fuck a day rate
Nigga

[Cassie:]
Your bossed up swag
Got 'em drooling like a new-born babe
The dollars in they eyes
Got 'em blinded by a Masquerade

The boys always spending all their money on love
The boys always spending all their money on love
They wanna touch it, taste it, see it, feel it, bone it, own it
Dollar, dollar, paper chase it, get that money

You get high, fuck a bunch of girls
And then cry on top of the world
I hope you have the time of your life
I hope I don't lose it tonight

[Nicki Minaj:]
I put you bitches on to them good lace fronts
Girls is my sons, carried them for 8 months
And yes you're premature
Young Money to the Core
I might give you a ticket so you can come see the tour
Oh that's your new girl?
That's that mid-grade
Buck 50 on yo face with the switch blade
Or the razor, yeah, the razor
She my son, yeah, but I ain't raise her
Goose me hater
I get that loose leaf paper
Them V-necks be studded out
T-Rex be gutted out
I told 'em Nicki be chilling them
I'mma keep hurting they feelings
Because you'll never be Jordan
You couldn't even be Pippen
You couldn't even be tripping
You can't afford a vacation
I'm out in Haiti with Haitians
I go to Asia with Asians
You mad dusty, you a lil dusty possum
I just come through with the six like my name was Blossom

[Cassie 2x:]
You get high, fuck a bunch of girls
And then cry on top of the world
I hope you have the time of your life
I hope I don't lose it tonight

The boys always spending all their money on love [4x]
