[Swae Lee, Young Thug & Future:]
Fall off in the spot
Wait up, they gon' do it while you drop
Metro!
Pull up with no top
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Swae Lee:]
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Hanging on my necklace, this ain't no ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fit pick you apart
Glowing in the dark, pretty young girls on board
Running with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde"

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo I'm me, I'm Barbie drippin', DB9, Barbie whippin'
If he say he don't want me back, he be lyin'
Bitch I'm the sauce, Barbie dippin', I'm the boss, Barbie sippin'
They keep tellin' work it, I ain't got no choice
I'm all yours, Barbie kissin', call the stores, Barbie shippin'
Out or indoors, baby I'ma floss
Wet, why of course, Barbie tippin', I endorse, Barbie strippin'
Mink carpet, but I ain't got no flaws
Doors look like rings, Barbie sittin', bad-da-bing, Barbie trippin'
Curve niggas like they arms in a slin'
Hot off the swing, Barbie swingin', to the ring, Barbie blingin'
Good box, so he called Donna King
Who the fuck gon' party with them dollies, tell' em never do the money till em hate you probably gon' sew
Who the fuck gon' cop me with the body, always thinkin' like a hottie, always saying what someone won't do
Who the fuck gonna pull up in your city, looking every bit pretty, with the itty bitty titty bitch crew
Who the fuck gon' beat him with a 22, if he don't lose the attitude, and run off with his credit cards too

Thousand dollar massage
I don't ever miss my mark
Anything I like goes in the cart
I might spend it all to prove a point
Rolling west coast, Arnold Schwarz
If she lick her lips then I'mma join
Indo I'mma spark
When I cash out its her favorite part

The swish, swish God? Yup, the swish God

[Swae Lee:]
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Aye you know I ain't like this, see no ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Put that thing in parts, I'ma let my fit pick you apart
Glowing in the dark, pretty little girls on a board
Running with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde"
