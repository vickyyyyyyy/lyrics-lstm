It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
Your "closure"

Don't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears
And my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"

I know I'm just a
Wrinkle in your new life
Staying "friends"
Would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake
And it's oh so unnecessary

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
"Closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"
