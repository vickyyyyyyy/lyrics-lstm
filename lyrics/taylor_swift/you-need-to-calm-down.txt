You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patr√≥n
And I'm just like, "Damn!
It's 7 AM"

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey!
Are you OK?"

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson
That stressing and obsessing
'Bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down"

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad
When you could be GLAAD?
(You could be GLAAD)

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Just making that sign
Must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats
And then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream
About all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown
You need to calm down"

And we see you over there on the Internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now
We all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
(You need to calm down)
You're being too loud
(You're being too loud)
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
(Can you stop?)
Like, can you just not step on our gowns
You need to calm down"
