Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through
Again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day

Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight.
Well, I stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why.

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home.
I should've known.

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism
To blame.
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love then take it away.

And you'll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who don't understand.
And I look back in regret.
How I ignored when they said,
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home.

Dear John,
I see it all now. It was wrong.
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played
By your dark twisted games?
When I loved you so.
I should've known.

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry.
Never impressed by me acing your tests.
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you've burned them out.

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me.
So, don't look now.
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town.

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home.

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song.
You should've known.

You should've known.
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known.
