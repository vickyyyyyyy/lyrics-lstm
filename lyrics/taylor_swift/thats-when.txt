You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said
"When can I come back?"
And you said

That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when
When it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when
I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when
When I see your face
I'll let you in
And baby that's when

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong
Made mistakes, and put you through all of this"
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I come back?"
And I said

That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when
When it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when
I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when
When I see your face
I'll let you in
And baby that's when

And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
And I said
That's when
When I woke up in the morning
That's when
It was sunny or storming
Laughing
When I was crying
And that's when you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby that's when

When I'm laughing
When I'm crying

That's when I miss you
That's when I want you
That's when I love you
That's when
