I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never want to see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Living in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company-e-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

[Single version:
Hey, kids
Spelling is fun]

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And I won't stop, baby)
I'm the only one of me
(I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh
(Baby, that's the fun of me)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh

Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh
