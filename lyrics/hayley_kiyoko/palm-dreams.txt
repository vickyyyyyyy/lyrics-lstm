Cruising down the only road
That leads me to a place that I know, I know
Traveled far, I've traveled wide
I had to go away to find home, I'm home

All the palm trees have the money
Watching from above the endless party
California, just a bad dream
I will hang around until you want me

From the hillside (they can party with us)
To the valley (they can party with us)
Watch the sun come up and warm my body
California (they can party with us)
Just a bad dream (they can party with us)
I will hang around until you break me

Star, stars
I'll make it to the top
I'm shining like their cars and rings
The palms see everything
Star, stars
They watch you like a hawk
I'll try to keep 'em company
The palms see everything

Riding all the highs and lows
I'm never looking back 'cause I know, I know
Walking through the danger zones
I'll make it anywhere 'cause I'm home, I'm home

All the palm trees have the money
Watching from above the endless party
California, just a bad dream
I will hang around until you want me

From the hillside (they can party with us)
To the valley (they can party with us)
Watch the sun come up and warm my body
California (they can party with us)
Just a bad dream (they can party with us)
I will hang around until you break me

Star, stars
I'll make it to the top
I'm shining like their cars and rings
The palms see everything
Star, stars
They watch you like a hawk
I'll try to keep 'em company
The palms see everything
Star, stars
I'll make it to the top
I'm shining like their cars and rings
The palms see everything
Star, stars
They watch you like a hawk
I'll try to keep 'em company
The palms see everything

My horizon, stars are shining
Feel them blind me as I get too close
My horizon, stars are shining
Feel them blind me as I get

Star, stars
I'll make it to the top
I'm shining like their cars and rings
The palms see everything
Star, stars
They watch you like a hawk
I'll try to keep 'em company
The palms see everything
Star, stars
I'll make it to the top
I'm shining like their cars and rings
The palms see everything
Star, stars
They watch you like a hawk
I'll try to keep 'em company
The palms see everything

If you party with us we'll go up (they can party with us)
