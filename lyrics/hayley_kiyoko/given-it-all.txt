If I make it on a tightrope
I'm not falling, I'm not crawling
you can't blame me, not for trying
I'm not foolish, I will get you.

Tear the walls down,
Don't be stupid,
meet me halfway to your heart.

Let the sun rise,
when it's dawning
And I'll break you,
till I break through

I've given it all to you [x8]
And it's got me...

Closer to the water,
we should set sail to the border

Tear the walls down,
Don't be stupid,
meet me halfway to your heart.

Let the sun rise,
when it's dawning
And I'll break you,
till I break through

I've given it all to you [x8]
And it's got me down...

Let the sun rise,
when it's dawning
Let the sun rise,
when it's dawning

You can't blame me, not for trying
I'm not foolish, I will get you

Let the sun rise,
when it's dawning
And I'll break you,
till I break through

Let the sun rise,
when it's dawning
And I'll break you,
till I break through

I've given it all to you [x8]
It's got me...

I've given it all to you [x4]
It's got me...

I've given it all to you [x4]
