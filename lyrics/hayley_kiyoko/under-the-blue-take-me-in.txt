[Under The Blue]

Fill my diamond pool
In a summer that's too cruel... cruel

Fill my diamond pool
In a summer that's too cruel... cruel

Drowning in the streams
To your town of broken dreams
You get lost in neon green
And you fall in the obscene
That's what you want (oh)
It's what you want

I could fill my diamond pool
In a summer that's too cruel
Riding on the ferris wheels
Tripping on your plastic heels
It's all you got (oh)
It's all you got

Waves come crashing on in
But I'm feeling the rapture cool on my skin
Take me under the blue
Take me under the blue

Fill my diamond pool
In a summer that's too cruel... cruel

Fill my diamond pool
In a summer that's too cruel... cruel

Howling like a beast
I was never following
It's the savage island scene
That you keep on channeling
That's what you want (oh)
It's what you want

Bathing in the thunder
Just because I make it loud
You don't ever have to wonder
I'm not trying to steal your crown
It's all you got (oh)
It's all you got

Waves come crashing on in
But I'm feeling the rapture cool on my skin
Take me under the blue
Take me under the blue

Waves come crashing on in
But I'm feeling the rapture cool on my skin
Take me under the blue
Take me under the blue

Fill my diamond pool
In a summer that's too cruel... cruel

Fill my diamond pool
In a summer that's too cruel... cruel

Waves come crashing on in
But I'm feeling the rapture cool on my skin
Take me under the blue
Take me under the blue

[Take Me In]

Drowning in the streams
To your town of broken dreams
You get lost in neon green
Howling like a beast
I was never following
It's the savage island scene

Take me under the blue
Take me under the blue
Take me under the blue
Take me under the blue
