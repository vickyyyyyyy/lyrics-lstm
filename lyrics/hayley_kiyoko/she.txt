She acts like she's in 7th grade
But actually she's 20-gay
And she been telling people she don't date that it ain't for her
She's been so in love for a real long time and it ain't her first

She keeps driving down the PCH
It's the only thing that numbs the pain

Don't wanna be dreamin', warm in bed
Don't wanna be old with one regret
Gotta be a diva, have respect
Be that girl you can't forget
If you try to make her less
She'll stand up and pound her chest
You'll be mad she ain't a part of your life
Miss do it right

She works all night, she's never home
Her momma taught her all she knows
She tried it, wore the mask and to put on a face but her feelings show
And everything that she ever says is taken wrong

She keeps driving down the PCH
It's the only thing that numbs the pain

Don't wanna be dreamin', warm in bed
Don't wanna be old with one regret
Gotta be a diva, have respect
Be that girl you can't forget
If you try to make her less
She'll stand up and pound her chest
You'll be mad she ain't a part of your life
Miss do it right

Done, she's gonna get it done
She'll do it on the run
But still have so much fun, fun
Done, she's gonna get it done
She'll do it on the run
But still have so much fun, fun

Don't wanna be dreamin', warm in bed
Don't wanna be old with one regret
Gotta be a diva, have respect
Be that girl you can't forget
If you try to make her less
She'll stand up and pound her chest
You'll be mad she ain't a part of your life
Miss do it right
