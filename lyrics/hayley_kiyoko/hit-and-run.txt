Mrs. scotch rocks, at the bar
Sweetheart, she sings, sings in the dark
Look at your face, look at my dress
Looks like we’re not here to impress

We’ll take the stairs, one two three steps at a time
Now that we’re here, all we gotta do is climb, climb

So pick me up again, and spin me ‘round
Deep in the lion’s den, we’re freaking out
So pick me up again, and spin me ‘round
Deep in the lion’s den, the secret’s out

We got our, got our sneakers on, just blink and we’ll be gone
Just like a smoking gun, we’re gonna hit and run

Sneakers on, just blink and we’ll be gone
Just like a smoking gun, we’re gonna hit and run

Tappin’ her shoes with polka dots
I like that bowtie, I like it a lot
Tappin’ my head, smashin’ the keys
Coins in the case, gold at your feet

We’ll take the stairs, one two three steps at a time
Now that we’re here, all we gotta do is climb, climb

So pick me up again, and spin me ‘round
Deep in the lion’s den, we’re freaking out
So pick me up again, and spin me ‘round
Deep in the lion’s den, the secret’s out

We got our, got our sneakers on, just blink and we’ll be gone
Just like a smoking gun, we’re gonna hit and run

Sneakers on, just blink and we’ll be gone
Just like a smoking gun, we’re gonna hit and run

(Won’t you pick me up, pick me up?)
(Won’t you pick me up, pick me up, spin me ‘round)

We got our, got our sneakers on, just blink and we’ll be gone
Just like a smoking gun, we’re gonna hit and run

So pick me up again, and spin me ‘round
Deep in the lion’s den, we’re freaking out
So pick me up again, and spin me ‘round
Deep in the lion’s den, the secret’s out

We got our, got our sneakers on, just blink and we’ll be gone
Just like a smoking gun, we’re gonna hit and run

Sneakers on, just blink and we’ll be gone
Just like a smoking gun, we’re gonna hit and run

Won’t you pick me up?
Won’t you pick me up?
Won’t you pick me up?
Won’t you pick me up?

(We’re gonna, gonna)
(Run)
