False start, ya sleepyhead
I'm caught up in the day with my night dreams
And my mistakes

Tell your vision no, you're acting
The little boys go on pretending
They're wide awake.

I'll settle on the dust, settle on the dust

But I've got better luck in my head
We're just ghosts inside my bed
I've got better luck in my head
Playing poker with the dead

This side of paradise [x4]

I'm not here, nor anywhere
I wanna be with you, you're unaware
I'm a paper weight

I fantasize
A secret life and place where we hide
It feels right

I'll settle on the dust, settle on the dust

But I've got better luck in my head
We're just ghosts inside my bed
I've got better luck in my head
Playing poker with the dead

This side of paradise [x4]

I don't want to be anywhere else
Than anywhere else but here
I don't want to be anywhere else
Than anywhere else but here

I don't want to be anywhere else
Than anywhere else but here
I don't want to be anywhere else
Than anywhere else but here

Cus I've got better luck in my head
We're just ghosts inside my bed
I've got better luck in my head
Playing poker with the dead

This side of paradise [x4]
