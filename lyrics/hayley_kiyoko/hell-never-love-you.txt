I left a mark on your neck
I know that you won't forget
Yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm the best you've ever had
Yeah cause I'm sweet like that
You you know, yeah you know
Playing with my finger tips,
Sitting there biting your lip
Trying to kiss
Who are you trying to trick?
Why don't you just cut the shit?

Cause baby you know that you got it
Girl yeah you know that you want it
Girl why can't you just be honest with yourself?

I know everyday you're thinking of me
I make it better when you're feelin' lonely
You say no one will understand
You wish you could but you just can't so

How many days?
How many nights?
'Til you realize
He'll never love you like me
He'll never love you like me

Talking until 3 a.m.
Giving me that look again
Yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm the drug you never did
Higher than you've ever been
Yeah you know, yeah you know

Took me like I was a hit
Addicted but trying to quit
Get over it
Act like you already did
So thirsty, you're drowning in it

Cause baby you know that you got it
Girl yeah you know that you want it
Girl why can't you just be honest with yourself

I know everyday you're thinking of me
I make it better when you're feelin' lonely
You say no one will understand
You wish you could but you just can't so

How many days?
How many nights?
'Til you realize
He'll never love you like me
He'll never love you like me

Cause he'll never love you like me
(He'll never, never, never, never, never, never-never)
(He'll never, never, never, never, never, never-never)

Hold on, you tell me that I'm not the one
But you know what is right you say is wrong
Playing with my finger tips
Sitting there biting your lip
Trying to kiss
Who are you trying to trick?
Why don't you just cut the shit?

Cause he'll never love you like me
(He'll never, never, never, never, never, never-never)
He'll never love you like me
(He'll never, never, never, never, never, never-never)
Cause he'll never love you like me
(He'll never, never, never, never, never, never-never)
He'll never love you like me
(He'll never, never, never, never, never, never-never)

I know everyday you're thinking of me
I make it better when you're feelin' lonely
You say no one will understand
You wish you could but you just can't so

How many days?
How many nights?
'Til you realize
He'll never love you like me
