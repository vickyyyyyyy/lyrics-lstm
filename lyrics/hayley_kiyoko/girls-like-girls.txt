Boy, boy, boys, boy

Stealin' kisses from your misses
Does it make you freak out?
Got you fussing, got you worried
Scared to let your guard down

Boys, boys

Tell the neighbours I'm not sorry
If I'm breaking walls down
Building your girl's second story
Ripping all your floors out

Saw your face, heard your name
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new

Isn't this why we came?
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new
Girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new

Boys

Always gonna steal your thunder
Watch me like a dark cloud
On the move, collecting numbers
I'mma take your girl out

We will be everything that we'd ever need (oh oh)
Don't tell me, tell me what I feel
I'm real and I don't feel like boys
I'm real and I don't feel like boys

Saw your face, heard your name
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new

Isn't this why we came?
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new
Girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new

I've been crossing all the lines, all the lines
Kissed your girls and made you cry, boys

Saw your face, heard your name
Gotta get with you
Girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new

Isn't this why we came?
Tell me if you feel it too!
Tell me, girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new
Girls like girls like boys do
Nothing new
