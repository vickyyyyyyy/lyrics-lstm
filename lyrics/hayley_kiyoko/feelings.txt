I walk through this world
Just trying to be nice
They say I'll get hurt
If I'm not like ice
I know I've got friends
I still get so lonely
If I look in your eyes
I'll want you to hold me

I'm sorry that I care, care
I'm sorry that I care, care
It's really not that fair, fair
I can't help but care...

I over communicate and feel to much
I just complicate it when I say too much
I laugh about it, dream about that casual touch
Sex is fire, sick and tired of acting all tough

I'm hooked on all these feelins
I know exactly what I'm feelin
This love asylum, like an island, just me and you
Spent the night, you got me high, O what did you do?

I'm hooked on all these feelings

There caught up inside
Both happy and lonely
Keep telling me lies
They're killing me slowly

I get too attached
They don't even know me
Why can't I relax
Why can't I relax
I'm sorry that I care, care
I'm sorry that I care, care
It's really not that fair, fair
I can't help but care...
I over communicate and feel to much
I just complicate it when I say too much
I laugh about it, dream about that casual touch
Your sex is fire, sick and tired of acting all tough
I'm hooked on all these feelings
I know exactly what I'm feeling
This love asylum, like an island, just me and you
Spent the night, you got me high, what did you do?

I'm hooked on all these feelings

I'm hooked on all these feelings
I know exactly what I'm feeling
I'm hooked on all these feelings
I know exactly what I'm feeling
