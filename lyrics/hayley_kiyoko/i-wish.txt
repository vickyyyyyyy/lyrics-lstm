I wish, I wish, I wish I found love
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love

I don't know where we're gon' go from here, I don't
You shut down when I tell you all the shit I want
We butt heads, you don't pay me no attention
And you're selfish with your affection (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't like when I decide to speak my mind (Yeah, yeah)
No, you don't like that I do what I want like all the time
We butt heads 'cause you don't pay me no attention
And you're selfish with your affection (Oh)

I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (Love)
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love
'Cause I wake up, up in the morning time
And there's nobody here by my side
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (Love)

You don't care, it's a storm in my iris 'cause you lied
You don't mind that it's raining oceans from my eyes
We butt heads 'cause you're payin' him attention
And you're selfish with your affection (What you want, love?)
Your black heart, you ain't even budge when you tore mine apart
You wyle out, so I wyle out out too, mothafucka wassup?
We butt heads 'cause you keep payin' him attention
And you're selfish with your affection (Oh)

I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (Love)
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love
'Cause I wake up, up in the morning time
And there's nobody here by my side
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (Love)

Sometimes I wonder if you ever will let me in
I wonder if I'm ever gonna find somebody
I cry, cry, cry cry to the heavens
Why won't you just send me somebody? (Oh)

I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (Oh, I wish I found love)
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love
'Cause I wake up, up in the morning time
And there's nobody here by my side
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (I wish I found love)
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (I wish I found love)
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (I wish I found love)
'Cause I wake up, up in the morning time
And there's nobody here by my side
I wish, I wish, I wish I found love (Love)
