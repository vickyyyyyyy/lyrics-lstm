I gave it all to you, left me exhausted
And the least you can do, not make me nauseous
Watching me watching you, I'm deep in quicksand
I'm falling into you, I'm into you, still into you

Guilty promises, get me off of this
I'ma freak, freak out
If you let me down, if you let me down
Like a little kid puffing out my lips
I'ma freak, freak out
If you let me down, if you let me down

If it's not in vain, let me hear you say
Something I won't make, make me run away
If you're not afraid, let me hear you say
Something I won't make, make me run away
Runaway

You're like a chemical, too good but toxic
Extreme, the highs and lows, tears like a faucet
As I look back at you, sinking in quicksand
I'm falling into you, I'm into you, still into you

Guilty promises, get me off of this
I'ma freak, freak out
If you let me down, if you let me down
Like a little kid puffing out my lips
I'ma freak, freak out
If you let me down, if you let me down

If it's not in vain, let me hear you say
Something I won't make, make me run away
If you're not afraid, let me hear you say
Something I won't make, make me run away
Runaway

If it's not in vain, let me hear you say
Something that won't make, make me run away
If you're not afraid, let me hear you say
Something that won't make, make me run away
Runaway

Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na (Runaway)
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na (Runaway)
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na (Runaway)
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na (Runaway)
