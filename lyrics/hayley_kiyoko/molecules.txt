Pillars of my heart
Everything got shattered in the dark
Tried to be evolved
Does it really matter at all?

Feathers on the red bed
Messy on the floorboards
Data in my head gets
Caught up in the drugstores
Make me feel again
Make me feel again

So what should I do?
All that's left is molecules of you
Tried to rearrange
Did you feel that everything was strange?

Dancing in the red rain
Tied up to the bedpost
Falling like a tear stain
Only for your cold ghost
Make me feel again
Make me feel again

I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you

(Nah nah na-nah na-nah nah)
(Nah nah na-nah na-nah)
(Nah nah na-nah na-nah nah)

Keep me wide awake
Every cell I feel your body ache
Can we stop the fall?
Does it really matter at all?

Feathers on the red bed
Messy on the floorboards
Data in my head gets
Caught up in the drugstores
Make me feel again
Make me feel again

(Nah nah na-nah na-nah nah)
(Nah nah na-nah na-nah)

I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you

(Nah nah na-nah na-nah nah)
(Nah nah na-nah na-nah)
(Nah nah na-nah na-nah nah)
