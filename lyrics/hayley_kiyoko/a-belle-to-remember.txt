Oh-oh-oh
(Oh-oh-oh)
Go ahead and break my...

Get out
You're so old
You're out
I'm cold
You got me untied
I'm in a beehive
I'm buzzing, stinging, wanting
My sweet
Begin a new flee
Your moves are off-beat
I'm tryna get by
I'm in the beehive
I'm wanting, feelings
You once had for me

So go ahead, break my heart
You'll keep hearing me from afar

Cause I'm a belle to remember
Do you remember?
A belle to remember
You'll want to love me
Belle to remember
Do you remember?
A belle to remember
You'll want to love me

Rebound you might have
The girls won't match
You try to get by
I can't leave your mind
I'm swimming...
You're wanting for me
To bad it's your loss
You left me undone
You said your goodbye
I've left my beehive
I'm searching, living, wanting some peace

Cause I'm a belle to remember
Do you remember?
A belle to remember
You'll want to love me
Belle to remember
Do you remember?
A belle to remember
You'll want to love me

Belle to remember
Do you remember?
A belle to remember
You'll want to love me

Belle to remember
Do you remember?
A belle to remember
You'll want to love me

Go ahead and break my heart
Go ahead and break my heart

Cause I'm a belle to remember
Do you remember?
A belle to remember
You'll want to love me
Belle to remember (go ahead, break my heart)
You'll keep hearing me from afar

I'm a belle to remember
Do you remember?
A belle to remember
You'll want to love me

Go ahead and break my heart
Go ahead and break my heart
