I'm getting excited

I get excited when I discover something rare
(like you)
I try to hide it but I
Can't help but creep and stare
I like your aura
And I'm pretty sure I love your hair

You're sweet as maple
You're sweet as maple
You're sweet as...

I'm cutting corners to find
Out what your name might be
Be-be-be
Digging through the trash to get
Your grande cup of coffee
Oh oh oh

You're sweet as maple
You're sweet as maple
You're sweet as...

Down, town, in the village
Strange sounds got me moving
Step in town with my feet
Somebody's always looking
Maple
Nothing's quite as sweet

I want to fly firefly
Into the blue lagoon
Tease you like I'm only five
And I will pick on you
Oh...

You're sweet as maple
You're sweet as maple
You're sweet as...

Down, town, in the village
Strange sounds got me moving
Step in town with my feet
Somebody's always looking
Maple (maple)
Nothing's quite as sweet
Nothing's quite as... sweet
