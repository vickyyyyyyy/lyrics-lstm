[Mercy]

When the city sleeps, I'm awake
Caught up in the dreams I can't create
When the city sleeps, I'm awake
Locked up in my mind, I can't escape
There's nothing I can do but wait
I call you crying 'cause it's too much pain
I can tell you don't get it
'Cause you tell me that everything will be okay

All I wanna do is cry
That's all I wanna do
All I wanna do is cry
And bang my head
Until I start to fly
Bang, bang, I start to fly
Bang, bang, I start to fly

Maybe, I'll just dye my hair
To make me feel like I don't care
It'll be my war paint
'Cause Lord knows I need the strength, I need the strength
Mondays might be alright
And Sundays will probably hurt
'Cause when your mouth starts moving with the noise
I don't hear a single word

All I wanna do is cry
That's all I wanna do
All I wanna do is cry
And bang my head
Until I start to fly
Bang, bang, I start to fly
Bang, bang, I start to fly
I watch the sky get brighter
The lights get higher now

Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Hurting, hurting

[Gatekeeper]

Stuck in the traffic that's racing in my mind
Blankets of wool just to cover up my eyes
'Cause what I need, what I need is quiet
And I know what I need, what I need is hiding
I'm just a face someone's passing on the street
Paint on a smile so that no one ever sees
'Cause what I need, what I need is quiet
And I know what I need, what I need is hiding

Talk to me, keep on, talk to me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Talk to me, keep on, talk to me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It's easier for me to stay quiet, not speak a word
For if I do, then the truth might emerge
They are my emotions to feel
Nobody can poison my feelings if they're never revealed
I'll watch others live in loudness and I'll destroy the chaos in my way
I have the control
If I keep what's mine, I can have the purest soul
And live with content, free from fear
I choose my actions
I am the gatekeeper

Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Just give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting
Hurting, hurting

Don't let me die
With my soul in the air
Don't let me die
When there's nobody here
