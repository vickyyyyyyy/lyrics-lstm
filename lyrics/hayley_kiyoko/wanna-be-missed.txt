Wanna be loved every night
Wanna know she's only mine
Breathe her in, give me life
Got all these hearts in a line
They all wasting their time
'Cause only you do me right

Baby, you should pick up the phone
'Cause I'm wondering if you're alone
'Cause I'm driving down Sunset
If you're around, come get it
Baby come, come get it

I wanna be missed like every night
I wanna be kissed like it's the last time
Say you can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe without me
I wanna be held, fragile like glass
'Cause I've never felt nothing like that
Say you can't walk, can't talk, go on without me

Want you tired every day
'Cause I run through your brain
Hold me down, keep me safe
This is as good as it gets
Don't you dare second guess
Only want you saying yes

Baby, you should pick up the phone
'Cause I'm wondering if you're alone
'Cause I'm driving down Sunset
If you're around, come get it
Baby come, come get it

I wanna be missed like every night
I wanna be kissed like it's the last time
Say you can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe without me
I wanna be held, fragile like glass
'Cause I've never felt nothing like that
Say you can't walk, can't talk, go on without me

Say, say you can't eat
Say, say you can't sleep
Say, say you can't breathe
You can't breathe without me
You can't breathe without me

I wanna be missed like every night
I wanna be kissed like it's the last time
Say you can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe without me
I wanna be held, fragile like glass
'Cause I've never felt nothing like that
Say you can't walk, can't talk, go on without me

I, I wanna be missed (so come hold me)
I, I wanna be kissed (so come feel me)
Come and make me feel missed
(I wanna be missed babe)
Girl come make me feel missed
(Come and miss me yeah)
I, I wanna be held (so come hold me)
I, I wanna be felt (so come feel me)
Come and make me feel missed
(Wanna make you feel it)
Girl, I wanna feel missed
Make me feel missed
