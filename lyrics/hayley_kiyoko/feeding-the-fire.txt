Stay or should I go
Give me 'yes' or 'no'
It's all a mystery
It's all the little things
Tell me what you want this to be
Tell me what you want me to see

I just can't catch a break
When everything's at stake
Looking for a way
Not a fast escape
I know what I want this to be
I know what I want me to see

Get your heavy weight off my back
I'm on the right track
And you're feeding the fire
Walk the thinnest line to get me back
I'm on the right track
And you're feeding the fire
You're feeding the fire

Let go of everything
Before we make it sting
You're dragging things along
But I can't sing that song
I know what I want this to be
I know what I want me to see

Get your heavy weight off my back
I'm on the right track
And you're feeding the fire
Walk the thinnest line to get me back
I'm on the right track
And you're feeding the fire
You're feeding the fire
You're feeding the fire

Go go just go
Go go just go
Go go just go
[x4]

Get your heavy weight off my back
I'm on the right track
And you're feeding the fire
Walk the thinnest line to get me back
I'm on the right track
And you're feeding the fire
You're feeding the fire
You're feeding the fire

Get your heavy weight off my back
You're feeding the fire

Get your heavy weight off my back
You're feeding the fire
You're feeding the fire

I'm on the right track
You're feeding the fire
