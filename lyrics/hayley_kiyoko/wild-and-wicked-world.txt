Days, they circle 'round
I'm no good for this twirl
When finally I wake
I'm out here on my own

Shout out loud, you won't know
Shout out loud, it won't show
I'll never make a sound
But I'm way, way, way down

Slow and steady stroke
Stubborn, beautiful
Careful as I go
In this wild and wicked world
I go

Take me to the moon
Where I can sleep 'til noon
Living my today
I don't care what you say

I scream and shout, they shun me out
And I'm trying hard to make it count
I get by, I can't deny
I know every single reason why

Slow and steady stroke
Stubborn, beautiful
Careful as I go
In this wild and wicked world
I go

Be careful of what we think we know
Black rivers turn to gold
Keep looking up
To feel the glow

Slow and steady stroke
Stubborn, beautiful
Careful as I go
In this wild and wicked world
I go

Careful as I go
In this wild and wicked world
I go
