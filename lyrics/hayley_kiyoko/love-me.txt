I would go to bat, take the L for you
But would you do the same for me?
I would go through heaven and hell for you
If you're always honest with me

So girl, don't tell me you love me
If you don't really want me
I'm working through my issues
Yeah, I'm going to kiss you
In front of everybody
That wants to be your honey
If you have a problem
Don't tell me you love me

All I want to do is bust a move
You got me begging, pretty please
I would throw away all of my revenue
If you swear you'd never leave

So girl, don't tell me you love me
If you don't really want me
I'm working through my issues
Yeah, I'm going to kiss you
In front of everybody
That wants to be your honey
If you have a problem
Don't tell me you love me

L.O.V.E. me
Let me be
Be your company
H.E.L.L.O.
Let me know
If you want to go

L.O.V.E. me
Let me be
Be your company
H.E.L.L.O.
Let me know
If you want to go

In the middle of the night
You don't mean what you're saying
In the middle of the night
Tell me what my heart is racing

So girl, don't tell me you love me
If you don't really want me
I'm working through my issues
Yeah, I'm going to kiss you
In front of everybody
That wants to be your honey
If you have a problem
Don't tell me you love me

L.O.V.E. me
Let me be
Be your company
H.E.L.L.O.
Let me know
If you want to go

L.O.V.E. me
Let me be
Be your company
H.E.L.L.O.
Let me know
If you want to go
