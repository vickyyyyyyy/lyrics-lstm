I hear you like a whisper
In the corner of my lovesick thoughts
Like sand through a filter
Trying to capture what time forgot
I need you to be here
I need to see you crystal clear
Like diamonds in a coal mine
In the moonlight when you appear

Girl ease my mind
Liquify
I need you mine
Can't fake it
'Cause you haunt me, baby
'Cause you haunt me, baby

I feel you in the wind chill
And it's so real, straight through my bones
I can only just imagine
Your passion, you take me home
I need you to be here
I need to see you crystal clear
Like rubies in the red night
In the dark sky when you appear

Girl ease my mind
Liquify
I need you mine
Can't fake it
'Cause you haunt me, baby
'Cause you haunt me, baby

Haunt me to my grave
Don't you ever fade away
Seeing every delusion
I don't want to face
You keep me up
You keep me up at night

Girl ease my mind
Liquify
I need you mine
Can't fake it
'Cause you haunt me, baby
'Cause you haunt me, baby

Girl ease my mind
Liquify
I need you mine
Can't fake it
'Cause you haunt me, baby
'Cause you haunt me, baby
