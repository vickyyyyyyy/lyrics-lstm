Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
(That's wild, that'll be nuts)

There's something in the water
I don't like the flavour, I don't like the taste
Searching for nirvana
Something that'll take it all away from me

Don't bother me, my misery
It's holding me, won't let me speak

Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head (In my head)
Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
Tryna eat me, tryna feed me lies until I'm dead ('Til I'm dead)
Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
In my head

It's creeping and it's gonna get me by the end of the night
I'm sinking deeper still, I'm reaching for the end of the light
Burning in the lava
You can't go and pray this type of pain away

Don't bother me, my misery
It's holding me, won't let me speak

Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head (In my head)
Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
Tryna eat me, tryna feed me lies until I'm dead ('Til I'm dead)
Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head

I feel like I can't breathe, I feel like I can't sleep
How did I not see? I'm unwell
I feel like I can't breathe, I feel like I can't sleep
How did I not see? I'm unwell
(Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head, in my head)
(Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head)

Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head (In my head)
Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
Tryna eat me, tryna feed me lies until I'm dead (In my head)
Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
In my head

Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
In my head
Please forgive me, I've got demons in my head
