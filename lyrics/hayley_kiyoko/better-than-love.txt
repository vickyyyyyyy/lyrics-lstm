I'll meet you back on Kingsley's street where we fell
For the only thing we ever feared.
Back where all the silence made my heart melt.
Where the sound of you was all I'd hear.

Da- da- do- do, da- da- do- do, Da- da- do- do, da- da- do- do

Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
Make this minute last forever
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Even when our love is gone you weren't wrong to have been
Mi-I-I-I-ine, mi-I-I-I-ine

Sitting watching movies, couch tomatoes.
Wanna kiss your eyes, those almond eyes.
Oh take me to that laurel view
Where it was just me and you
Those were the days, holidays.

Da- da- do- do, da- da- do- do, Da- da- do- do, da- da- do- do

Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
Make this minute last forever
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Even when our love is gone you weren't wrong to have been
Mine

I want you to know
That my heart is better than before
All those times, changing our minds
What your worth, made it fine
Cause you know
That in my mind

I'll meet you back on Kingsley's street where we fell
For the only thing we ever feared.

Da- da- do- do, da- da- do- do, Da- da- do- do, da- da- do- do

Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
Make this minute last forever
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Better than love
Oh you can take it from me ever
You were mi-I-I-I-ine, you were mi-I-I-I-ine
Somebody tell me what's better than love?
Even when our love is gone you weren't wrong to have been
Mine
