I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna think about it
I'm just feeling low, feeling low
Even when you're next to me
It's not the way I'm picturing
I'm just feeling low, feeling low
You wanna be friends forever
I can think of something better,
I'm just feeling low, feeling low
Sleeping here right next to me,
But will you ever mess with me? No.

But at least I got you in my head, oh yeah
At least I got you in my head, in my head,
Sleepovers in my bed, oh yeah
At least I got you in my head, in my head
In my head
In my head

Always there to brush your hair,
Help you pick out what to wear
I just feel alone, feel alone
You will never understand
Even when you hold my hand
I just feel alone, feel alone
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna think about it
I just feel alone, feel alone
Even when you're next to me
It's not the way I'm picturing, no

But at least I got you in my head, oh yeah
At least I got you in my head, in my head, ooo, ooo
Sleepovers in my bed, oh yeah
At least I got you in my head, in my head
In my head
In my head

Come on, let's sleep in my bed,
Can I just be in my head with you?
Come on, let's sleep in my bed,
Can I just be in my head with you?
And it breaks my heart, yeah it breaks my heart
I do this every single time, every time

But at least I got you in my head, oh yeah
At least I got you in my head, in my head,
Sleepovers in my bed, oh yeah
At least I got you in my head, in my head
