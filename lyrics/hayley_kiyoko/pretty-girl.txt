Thursday nights I like
Seeing you under the stars' light
Through the fire as bright
Wanna know what your love feels like

I can see you're real smart
World class piece of art
I can see you in the dark
All we have to do is start

I just wanna tell you that you're really pretty girl
I just wanna know if you will let me be your world
I just know you got to taste like candy, candy girl
I just wanna tell you that you're really pretty girl

You're the one I like
I will find a reason tonight
Feel it all despite
The fact you don't like my type

I can see you're real smart
World class piece of art
I can see you in the dark
All we have to do is start

I just wanna tell you that you're really pretty girl
I just wanna know if you will let me be your world
I just know you got to taste like candy, candy girl
I just wanna tell you that you're really pretty girl

Wait, let me in
I want to show you the shape I'm in
Wait, let me in
I want to show you the shape I'm in
Wait, let me in
I want to show you the shape I'm in
Wait, let me in
I want to show you the shape I'm in

I just wanna tell you that you're really pretty girl
I just wanna know if you will let me be your world
I just know you got to taste like candy, candy girl
I just wanna tell you that you're really pretty girl
