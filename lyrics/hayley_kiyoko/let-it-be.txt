Baby come around cause I need you
Baby calm me down, let me see you
Cause you know you're my operator
Let me show every single layer

Losing all my power just to have you
Hundred miles an hour, thinking 'bout you
Every night gets a little tougher
How can I dream about another, cause

I believe we're the ones who had it all
I believe we just had to learn to fall
I miss ya, I love ya
So it's really hard to see, yeah
We just gotta let it be

Oooh let us see
Be free

Baby come around cause I want ya
Laying on the floor here without ya
Cause you know your my operator
Help me show every single layer

Giving "baby steps" a new meaning
Yeah, I'm making such a mess of my feelings
Won't you just meet me in the middle
Where's the love? Won't you give a little, cause

I believe we're the ones who had it all
I believe we just had to learn to fall
I miss ya, I love ya
So it's really hard to see, yeah
We just gotta let it be

Oooh let us see
Be free

Oooh let us see
Be free

Can't imitate us, it's breaking my bones
Caught up in chaos that keeps me alone
Wasted the beautiful all on my own
I'm making a new home
Washing the sheets cause you're still in my bed
Can't leave the dark cause you're all in my head
All in my head and it's killing me
And it's killing me cause we're at the end

I believe we're the ones who had it all
I believe we just had to learn to fall
I miss ya, I love ya
So it's really hard to see, yeah
We just gotta let it be
