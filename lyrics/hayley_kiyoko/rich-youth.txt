I found out it's all a plot
Polar bears aren't getting lost
They just want to get rid of us

Neighbours take their daily stroll
Through their fate they don't control
Treading water in the wishing well

I'm giving all my energy
I'm making my own history
I'm no ghost
No fool
Rich Youth
Brand new
Unused
Rich Youth

Living, falling into deep
Got no time to meet their needs
Oh my god
Let me be free

I'm giving all my energy
I'm making my own history
I'm no ghost
No fool
Rich Youth
Brand new
Unused
Rich Youth

I'm no ghost
No fool
Rich Youth
Brand new
Unused
Rich Youth

We make something out of nothing
We keep climbing
Climbing
We make something out of nothing
We keep climbing
Climbing
We make something out of nothing
We keep climbing
Climbing
We make something out of nothing
We keep climbing
Climbing

I'm no ghost
No fool
Rich Youth
Brand new
Unused
Rich Youth
