Swing a little further, higher
Underneath the big top trees
Scrape my knees, whatever, uh huh
I'm gonna let them bleed
Got no turning back, I'mma flirt with that
Get a little closer [2x]

Cliff's edge, you turn me on
You lead me on
You got me on
A cliff's edge, where I belong
You got me on
And turn me on
I wanna feel that sea breeze [2x]

Love until we burn up, fire
Do whatever gets you seen
Kiss me with adventure
Til I forget my name
Chills run down my back, I'mma flirt with that
Get a little closer [2x]

Cliff's edge, you turn me on
You lead me on
You got me on
A cliff's edge, where I belong
You got me on
You turn me on
I wanna feel that sea breeze [2x]

[2x]
Closing in closer to you
This could take all night
Caving and crumbling on your
Hips, your lips, they're mine

Cliff's edge, you turn me on
You lead me on
You got me on
A cliff's edge, where I belong
You got me on
And turn me on
I wanna feel that sea breeze [x2]

I wanna feel that sea breeze [2x]
