Catch my name for kicks
Thinking I would be right by your side
I don't feel adequate
Thinking I'm a monster in disguise

We've gone down every list
Stuck but I have got to begin to resist
Caught up with the fact that life will be dark
But can we handle being kids?

I'll do this my way
Don't matter if I break
I gotta be on my own
Lost in this feeling
Don't never need a reason
I gotta be on my own

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta be on my own

Try to stand the test
But the night is crawling through my eyes
I thought I was depressed
But I think I just needed to cry

I'll do this my way
Don't matter if I break
I gotta be on my own
Lost in this feeling
Don't never need a reason
I gotta be on my own

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta be on my own

I'll do this my way
Don't matter if I break
I gotta be on my own
Lost in this feeling
Don't never need a reason
I gotta be on my own

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
