There's a silent peace
In the tragedies
Water washes clean
Until they're dry
Turn your shattered dreams
Into rhapsodies

This is where I keep you in my mind
I need you to be free

So this is where I leave you
Sitting in a palace covered in gold inside my head
This is where I see you
On a bed of roses when I wanna kiss your silhouette

This where I leave you

Every memory adds another piece
Purple, blue, and green
Just rest your eyes
Fortunes in the trees
Pure as harmony

This is where I keep you in my mind
I need you to be free

So this is where I leave you
Sitting in a palace covered in gold inside my head
This is where I see you
On a bed of roses when I wanna kiss your silhouette

This is where I leave you
Sitting in a palace covered in gold inside my head
This is where I see you
On a bed of roses when I wanna kiss your silhouette
This where I leave you

Dance in your color
Reflecting in your light
You're my horizon
You'll always paint my sky

This is where I leave you
Sitting in a palace covered in gold inside my head
This is where I see you
On a bed of roses when I wanna kiss your silhouette
This is where I leave you
Sitting in a palace covered in gold inside my head
This is where I see you
On a bed of roses when I wanna kiss your silhouette
This where I leave you
