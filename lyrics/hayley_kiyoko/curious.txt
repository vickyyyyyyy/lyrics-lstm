Yeah

I need a drink, whiskey ain't my thing
But shit is all good
I can handle things-like I wish that you would

You've been out of reach, could you explain?
I think that you should
What you been up to-who's been loving you good?

I'm just on the floor, I'm like a model
Been looking through the texts and all the photos
But don't you worry, I can handle it
No don't you worry, I can handle it

If you let him
Touch ya touch ya touch ya touch ya touch ya touch ya (yeah)
The way I
Used to used to used to used to used to used to (yeah)

Did you take him to the pier in Santa Monica?
Forget to bring your jacket wrap up in him cause you wanted to?

I'm just curious, is it serious?
I'm just curious, is it serious?

Calling me up, so late at night
Are we just friends?
You say you wanted me-but you're sleeping with him

You think of me, I'm what you see
When you look at the sky
I don't believe you-you ain't been loving me right (yeah)

I'm just on the floor, I'm like a model
Been looking through the texts and all the photos
But don't you worry, I can handle it
No don't you worry, I can handle it

If you let him
Touch ya touch ya touch ya touch ya touch ya touch ya (yeah)
The way I
Used to used to used to used to used to used to (yeah)

Did you take him to the pier in Santa Monica?
Forget to bring your jacket wrap up in him cause you wanted to?

I'm just curious, is it serious?
